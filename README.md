# GoProxi
GoProxi is a research and prototyping framework for working with proxemics and proximity in delivering content to various mobile and stationary devices. The core idea is that you can associate information with a specific location (room, area etc.) and then automatically redirect users to that resource within an ordinary browser.

## Requirements
The software runs on a Raspberry PI (2/3/Zero) and requires a network adapter capable of running in monitor mode. Access to a WLAN supporting WPA/WPA2 authentication is also needed for running GoProxi installations.

## Installation
You can either download [GoProxi.img]() an create a bootable SD card for your Raspberry Pi or clone this repository and run setup.sh on your Raspberry PI.

GoProxi will install nmap, hostapd, dnsmasq, libpcap-dev and wireless-tools as part of the installation. It will run on startup and check for updates.
